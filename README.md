### Exercise 1: Create a Flexbox Gallery

**Objective:**
Build a gallery layout using Flexbox to practice aligning items, controlling spacing, and creating responsive designs.

**Instructions:**

1. **HTML Structure:**

   - Create an HTML file named `flexbox_gallery.html`.
   - Define the basic structure of an HTML document.
   - Inside the `<body>` tag, create a `<div>` with a class of `"gallery"`.
   - Within the gallery div, include multiple image elements (use placeholder images or real images).

2. **CSS Styling with Flexbox:**

   - Create a CSS file named `styles.css`.
   - Link the CSS file to your HTML document using a `<link>` tag.
   - Apply Flexbox styles to the gallery layout:
     - Set the display property of the gallery container to `flex`.
     - Use Flexbox properties like `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, and `align-items` to arrange the images in a grid-like pattern.
     - Adjust spacing between images using `margin` or other Flexbox properties.
     - Experiment with additional Flexbox properties to achieve the desired layout.

3. **Testing and Refinement:**
   - Open the HTML file in a web browser to view the Flexbox gallery layout.
   - Make adjustments to the HTML and CSS as needed to improve the layout and appearance.
   - Test the responsiveness of the gallery by resizing the browser window.

**Bonus Challenges:**

- Implement a responsive design that adjusts the number of columns based on screen size.
- Add hover effects to the gallery items (e.g., scale up on hover).
- Incorporate media queries to adjust Flexbox properties for different viewport sizes.

### Exercise 2: Build a Flexbox Navigation Bar

**Objective:**
Create a navigation bar using Flexbox to practice aligning items, controlling spacing, and creating responsive designs.

**Instructions:**

1. **HTML Structure:**
   - Create an HTML file named `flexbox_navbar.html`.
   - Define the basic structure of an HTML document.
   - Inside the `<body>` tag, create a `<nav>` element with a class of `"navbar"`.
   - Within the navbar, include multiple navigation links (`

<a>` elements).

2. **CSS Styling with Flexbox:**
   - Create a CSS file named `styles.css`.
   - Link the CSS file to your HTML document using a `<link>` tag.
   - Apply Flexbox styles to the navigation bar:
     - Set the display property of the navbar container to `flex`.
     - Use Flexbox properties like `justify-content` and `align-items` to position the navigation links horizontally or vertically.
     - Add spacing between links using `margin` or other Flexbox properties.
     - Style the navigation links for better visibility and user interaction.
3. **Testing and Refinement:**
   - Open the HTML file in a web browser to view the Flexbox navigation bar.
   - Make adjustments to the HTML and CSS as needed to improve the layout and appearance.
   - Test the responsiveness of the navigation bar by resizing the browser window.

**Bonus Challenges:**

- Implement a hamburger menu for smaller screen sizes using Flexbox and media queries.
- Add animations or transitions to the navigation links for smoother interaction.
- Experiment with different Flexbox properties to create unique navigation bar designs.
